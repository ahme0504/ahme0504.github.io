For my work portfolio, I wanted to give it a clean and simple look because I think it's important for my photographs to be the eye-catching part. I decided it was important to have my initial homepage a portfolio page that it's like a collage of my photography work and a final about page. My idea of my website going in was something I could send one showing my work as a freelance photographer. Since that was the purpose of my website as I didn't feel like I needed a contact form I would already be in contact with somebody if I was sending on my portfolio link. One of the first challenges I faced was on my original mock-up of my mobile layout change to a carousel for my portfolio. Once I tried to create a carousel some of the images weren't working or we're not displaying so add to figure out another way to display the images on mobile. With this assignment being for myself I felt like I could target my brand look very well. I also felt very comfortable when doing the layout because of the bootstrap grid where with other assignments I would have had a little bit of a harder time. Throughout the assignment when I had difficulties or something wasn't working I knew exactly right away another option I could use instead of having to search for one cuz I had a better understanding of what was going on.
